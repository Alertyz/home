        <p class="container text-center top">Hi, there my name is Alec as you probably read on the homepage, I'm 18 years old and I live in Brazil in the state of São Paulo, I have had a passion for electronics and video games since I was little and because of that, I was inspired to take the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science on EDX.</p>
        <p class="container text-center middle">The video game that I'm playing the most now is called valorant, the game is a tactical shooting game involving two teams with 5 players in each team but video games are not the only thing I like, I also love films, TV shows, and animes being my favorite film spider man into the spider-verse, my favorite TV-show Doctor-who, and my favorite anime HunterXHunter.</p>
        <p class="container text-center end">Well, that is pretty much everything, I hope you have enjoyed your stay here on my website(making these is not my best strength) and I hope you have the best of years in front of you, thank you for reading and depending on where you are, have my warm or refreshing GoodBye.</p>
